This was the first assignment in python where I have done following task-

1.Implement a program that requests three strings from the user. Your program should concatenate the first two strings (string1 + string2) and compare the 
  concatenated string with the third string. If they are equal, your program should print “They are equal”, otherwise, the program should concatenate the two 
  strings in the reverse order (string2 + string1) and compare it with the third string and print “They are also equal”. If this second test also fails, your 
  program should print “They are not equal”.

2.Write a Python program that reads in 3 integers or 4 integers (user first determines 3 or 4 integers) and displays the following: the average of the numbers 
  (round to the closest integer, use < .5 to round down and >= .5 to round up ) the maximum of the numbers the minimum of the numbers the median of the numbers. 
  Note that if there was 2 numbers that qualify for the median, you will calculate and display the mean of the 2 numbers (round to the closest integer, use < .5 
  to round down and >= .5 to round up )

3.A number that is greater than 1 that is not a prime number is called a composite number. An integer, greater than 1, that is only divisible by 1 and itself 
  is called a prime number. The integers 0 and 1 are neither prime nor composite. Write a python program that requests a positive integer from the user, 
  determines if it is a composite, a prime or neither prime or composite and prints the message. You can choose to use iterative loops to repeatedly run this 
  script or have the user run the script for every input.

4.Implement a Python function called SmartDivision() that takes two integer arguments. Your function should return the result of the division of the two 
  integers. If the result is an integer, the return type should be an integer. If the result is a floating point number, the return type should be a floating 
  point number.

5.Write a program that takes as input two opposite corners of a rectangle: (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) – float or integer only. Finally, the user is prompted for the 
  coordinates of a third point (x,y). The program should print Boolean value True or False based on whether the point (x,y) lies within the rectangle. At the 
  end of each run, the user should be prompted to ask whether they want to continue.
