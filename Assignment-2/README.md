1.Define a function called positivity generator. The function should take user input of a sentence, and find the first appearance of the substring 'not' and 
'bad' from the user input. If 'not' appears before the 'bad', the function should replace the whole 'not'...'bad' substring with 'good'. Return the resulting 
string. Note your function should be able to handle user input with difference cases.

2.Write a function that accepts a line of text and a single letter as input (your program should be able to handle all upper and lower cases) and returns the 
number of times this letter is the second last character of a word. Note your program should be able to handle different cases. And check if the user input 
is a single letter.

3.Write a Python program to ask user input of a string, then ask user input of what letters they want to remove from the string. User can either put in "odd",
"even" or a number "n" that is greater than 2. When user input "odd", it will remove the characters which have odd numbers in the sequence of the string. 
When user input "even", it will remove the characters which have even numbers in the sequence of the string. When user input "n" number, it will remove the 
characters which have nth numbers in the sequence of the string. Note that we are talking about the sequence of the letters, so the first letter in a string 
is number 1, the second is number 2, and so on.

4.Write a Python program to create a Caesar encryption. Your program will first ask for the input of a secret message, then ask how many places you wish to 
shift each letter in the alphabet. In the end, your program will produce the shifted secret message as a string. Your program should be able to handle all 
upper and lower cases, and check if the user inputs are valid.

5.Write a Python program to ask how many elements do users want to create in a list, then let the user create 2 lists with the number of elements previously 
entered. Then create and display all combinations of letters, selecting each letter from a different key in a dictionary.
